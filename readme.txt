========================
CRYOGENIC ENGINES v2.0.7
========================

This is a pack with several new liquid fuel engines that run on Liquid Hydrogen and Oxidizer or Liquid Methane and Oxidizer. Liquid Hydrogen is a messy fuel that leaks out of most tanks (slowly) and takes up a lot of space compared to stock Liquid Fuel. However engines using it have the highest possible chemical specific impulse, so it can be quite useful. Liquid Methane is a middle of the road fuel that has a volume between Liquid Fuel and Liquid Hydrogen. It still leaks, but not as fast. In all cases, leakage can be countered by using a modest amount of power. 
Included are patches that allow all stock fuel tanks to contain the appropriate resources, and a set of new specialized fuel tanks that are insulated to stop leakage.

I recommend removing any previous versions of CryoEngines before installing an update.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

======================

Some extra patches are bundled that you can use to tweak your installation. To install them, drop the correct folder from the Extras folder in this archive into your KSP GameData Folder

CryoEnginesLFO: Converts engines to use LF/O instead of LCH4/O or LH2/O at the cost of some Isp
CryoEnginesNFAero: Surface attach all engines
CryoEnginesRestock: Converts ReStock and Restock+ engines that 'should' be cryogenic to cryogenics
